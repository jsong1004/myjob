## 🚀 **Next Steps for Local Development**

### 1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Copy the environment file
cp env.example .env.local

# The Firebase config is already filled in with your project details
```

### 2. **Firebase Service Account (Local Development)**
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/myresume-457817/settings/serviceaccounts)
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Save the downloaded JSON file as `service-account-key.json` in your project root
4. The file is already in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed

### 3. **Firebase Setup**
1. **Enable Authentication:**
   - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
   - Enable Email/Password
   - Enable Google (configure OAuth consent screen)

2. **Create Firestore Database:**
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database in production mode
   - Use the security rules from `firestore.rules`

3. **Deploy Security Rules:**
   ```bash
   # Install Firebase CLI if not already installed
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   
   # Login to Firebase
   firebase login
   
   # Initialize Firebase (select Firestore only)
   firebase init firestore
   
   # Deploy the security rules
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

### 4. **Test the Application**
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test features:
# ✅ Sign up with email/password
# ✅ Sign in with email/password  
# ✅ Sign in with Google
# ✅ User profile in header dropdown
# ✅ Sign out functionality
```

- ✅ **User Sign In** - Email/password and Google OAuth
- ✅ **User Management** - Profile display, user state persistence
- ✅ **Security** - Protected routes, user data isolation

### UI/UX
- ✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all screen sizes
- ✅ **Loading States** - Proper feedback during auth operations
- ✅ **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- ✅ **Form Validation** - Client-side validation with helpful messages

### Backend
- ✅ **Firestore Integration** - User documents created automatically
- ✅ **Security Rules** - Proper data protection
- ✅ **Session Management** - Persistent auth state

## 🔄 **What's Next: Phase 2**

The next phase will integrate external APIs:
- **SerpApi** for job search data
- **OpenRouter API** for AI-powered matching and summarization
- **API route handlers** for backend operations

### Ready for Phase 2?
All authentication and user management is now working! Users can:
1. ✅ Create accounts and sign in
2. ✅ Have their data securely stored in Firestore
3. ✅ Navigate the app with proper auth state
4. ✅ Access protected features (once implemented)

The foundation is solid - let's move to Phase 2! 🚀
