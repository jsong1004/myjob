- **User Onboarding Process (Issue #31):** Implemented streamlined onboarding flow for new users. After sign-up (either via email/password or Google OAuth), users are automatically redirected to the resume upload page with a welcome message and the upload dialog pre-opened. This ensures all users have the required resume to use the job matching features from the start.
- **Improved Resume Format Processing (Issue #32):** Enhanced file upload processing to preserve document formatting when converting resumes to markdown. Added intelligent text parsing that detects resume structure including headers, contact information, job titles, dates, and bullet points. Supports PDF, DOCX, TXT, and Markdown files with automatic formatting enhancement for better readability and AI processing.
- **Admin Dashboard Refactoring (Issue #33):** Redesigned admin interface with a modern two-column layout (3:7 ratio). Left sidebar provides navigation between admin functions including All User Activities and User Management. Right content area displays detailed information with improved filtering, sorting, and data visualization. Added comprehensive user management with statistics and enhanced activity monitoring.
- **Admin Page Layout Improvement (Issue #34):** Updated admin interface from two-column layout to a cleaner stacked card design. Admin Actions are now displayed as compact navigation links in a minimal card at the top, followed by the content card below. Removed unnecessary descriptive text and reduced whitespace for a more streamlined interface with better space utilization and improved mobile responsiveness.
- **Admin Users API Bug Fixes (Issue #35):** Fixed critical bugs in the admin users data fetching that caused "undefined" errors and incorrect data counts. Resolved undefined uid handling in Firestore queries, fixed cover letters collection name mismatch (cover-letters vs coverLetters), and improved error handling with proper fallback logic. Added debugging logs and reduced admin page top margin for better layout.
- **Landing Page and Authentication Flow (Issue #36):** Created an attractive landing page for unauthenticated users that showcases the platform's features and benefits. The home page now acts as a marketing and onboarding page for new users, while authenticated users are automatically redirected to the job search functionality. Moved the original job search UI to a dedicated `/search` route with updated navigation links throughout the application. The landing page includes hero section, feature highlights, benefits overview, success stories, and call-to-action buttons.
- **Profile Photo Upload (Issue #37):** Implemented complete photo upload functionality in the profile page using Firebase Storage. Users can now upload and change their profile photos with support for JPEG, PNG, and WebP formats up to 5MB. Features include real-time upload progress, comprehensive file validation, error handling, and automatic synchronization with Firebase Auth user profile. The uploaded photo appears throughout the application including the header navigation and profile pages.
- **Advanced Application Tracking (Issue #38):** Enhanced the saved jobs functionality with comprehensive application tracking features. Users can now set custom statuses (Saved, Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected, Withdrawn) with color-coded badges, add personal notes to each application, set reminder dates with custom notes for follow-ups, and receive notifications for upcoming reminders. The interface includes powerful filtering by job title, company, and status, plus sortable columns for better organization. The page layout has been optimized with reduced whitespace for improved usability.
- **Resumes Page Refactoring (Issue #39):** Transformed the resumes page from a card-based layout to a clean, organized table format similar to the jobs page. The new table structure displays resumes with sortable columns for Resume Name and Created Date, content preview with hover tooltips, and streamlined actions. Default resumes are highlighted with background color and star icons, always appearing at the top of the list. The interface provides better space utilization, easier comparison of multiple resumes, and a more professional appearance for resume management.
- **Cover Letters Sorting and Navigation (Issues #41 & #42):** Added comprehensive sorting functionality to the cover letters page with clickable column headers for Name, Job Title, Company, and Created Date. Implemented visual sort indicators and enhanced the table with company detail links. Fixed navigation bug where company detail pages always showed "Back to Saved Jobs" regardless of origin - now dynamically displays "Back to My Cover Letters" when accessed from the cover letters page, providing context-aware navigation throughout the application.
- **Manual Job Addition (Issue #43):** Implemented the ability for users to manually add jobs to their saved jobs list. Added an "Add Job" button in the saved jobs page header (similar to the "Add Resume" button in the resumes page) that opens a comprehensive modal form. Users can input job title, company, location, salary, apply URL, and detailed job description. Created a dedicated API endpoint `/api/saved-jobs/add-manual` that generates unique job IDs for manually added jobs and integrates seamlessly with the existing saved jobs functionality. Manual jobs appear in the saved jobs table with full support for all existing features including status tracking, notes, reminders, and AI-powered resume tailoring.
- **Cover Letter Header Improvement (Issue #44):** Removed the hiring manager section from cover letter generation to create cleaner, more professional cover letters. Implemented intelligent applicant information extraction that first attempts to parse contact details from the resume, then falls back to user profile data when information is missing. Added placeholder handling for missing information to ensure cover letters always have proper formatting. The system now automatically populates candidate name, email, phone, and address from available sources, eliminating manual entry requirements while maintaining professional presentation standards.
- **Manual Job Scoring Implementation (Issue #45):** Implemented comprehensive AI-powered matching scores for manually added jobs. Created dedicated `/api/jobs/score` endpoint for job scoring functionality using the same OpenRouter AI analysis as automated job searches. Enhanced manual job addition to automatically score jobs against user's default resume during creation. Added "Generate Match Score" button with refresh icon for existing manual jobs that lack scores, enabling users to rescore jobs at any time. The system intelligently fallback to any available resume when no default is set, ensuring all manual jobs receive proper matching analysis with detailed scoring summaries.
- **Chat Message Overflow Fix (Issue #46):** Fixed text overflow issue in Q&A chat interfaces where AI responses would spill outside the designated message containers. Added proper text wrapping, word breaking, and scrollable containers to all chat interfaces including resume tailoring, cover letter generation, and resume editing pages. Chat messages now properly contain long responses within their visual boundaries with `max-h-96` scrollable areas and comprehensive word-wrap styling for better user experience.
- **Q&A Chat Interface Improvements (Issue #46):** Completely restructured the AI assistant interface across all chat pages with improved UX design. Split the AI Assistant into two separate cards: a compact Mode Selection card and a larger scrollable Q&A Chat card. Removed unnecessary headers and debug sections to maximize content space. Fixed user message text visibility with proper white text on blue backgrounds. Aligned resume preview and chat card heights for consistent layout. Implemented multi-line input support with Textarea components allowing Enter key for new lines while requiring Send button clicks for message submission. Enhanced markdown rendering for AI responses with proper formatting of bold text, headers, lists, and links. Applied consistent styling and behavior across resume tailoring, cover letter generation, and resume editing pages.
- **Comprehensive Prompt Centralization System (Issue #51):** Implemented a complete centralized prompt management system that consolidates all LLM prompts across the application. Created a structured directory system (`lib/prompts/`) with organized prompt categories for job matching, resume processing, and cover letter generation. Built a sophisticated PromptManager class with features including caching, retry logic, error handling, and usage statistics. Developed comprehensive prompt libraries with multiple variants (professional, basic, creative, technical) for different use cases. All API endpoints have been migrated to use the centralized system, removing 400+ lines of duplicate code while improving maintainability, consistency, and performance. The system includes full TypeScript support, version control for prompts, and built-in monitoring capabilities.
- **Enhanced Job Matching with Multi-Agent Scoring (Issue #50):** Implemented a sophisticated multi-agent scoring system that replaces the single-prompt approach with 8 specialized AI agents working in parallel. The system includes dedicated agents for technical skills assessment, experience depth evaluation, achievements analysis, education verification, soft skills assessment, career progression review, strengths identification, and weaknesses analysis. Features an orchestration agent that combines all results using weighted scoring (Technical Skills 25%, Experience 25%, Achievements 20%, Education 10%, Soft Skills 10%, Career Progression 10%) with business logic validation. The new system provides 8x faster execution through parallel processing, more accurate and detailed scoring breakdowns, robust error handling with fallback mechanisms, and comprehensive hiring manager perspective analysis. Fixed critical bugs including score calculation errors (6850% ‚Üí proper 0-100% range), mock data display issues, and refresh functionality problems. The enhanced scoring provides detailed insights including key strengths, areas for improvement, red flags, positive indicators, hiring recommendations, and interview focus areas for more thorough candidate evaluation.
- **Multi-Agent Resume Tailoring System (Issue #53):** Implemented an advanced multi-agent resume tailoring system that automatically activates when enhanced job scoring data is available. The system features 8 specialized agents (Technical Skills, Experience, Achievement, Education, Soft Skills, Career Progression, ATS Optimization, and Strategic Orchestration) working in parallel to provide targeted resume optimization. When jobs have enhanced scoring analysis, the tailoring interface automatically switches to multi-agent mode with visual indicators including a gradient "Multi-Agent" badge and specialized tooltip descriptions. The system uses job match analysis as input to provide data-driven improvements that address identified gaps and strengthen weak areas, resulting in more effective resume optimization compared to the legacy single-agent approach. Enhanced with on-demand scoring generation for jobs without existing analysis, automatic default resume loading when missing from requests, and robust error handling that ensures valid markdown content is always returned to the frontend.
- **Saved Jobs Page UX Enhancement:** Completely redesigned the saved jobs interface with improved action button visibility and intuitive layout. Replaced small, unclear icons with clear labeled buttons in a 2x2 grid format: "Resume" and "Cover" buttons for primary actions (with visual status indicators showing green when completed), and "Edit" and "Remove" buttons for secondary actions. Enhanced the table with optimized column ordering (Job Title, Company, Details, Score, Actions, Status, Notes), reduced whitespace between columns for better space utilization, left-aligned Actions column header, and horizontal scrolling support for responsive design. Added universal "Generate Match Score" refresh icons to all jobs for consistent scoring capabilities. Improved job title links with enhanced URL detection and blue link styling for better visual distinction. The new design provides clearer user guidance and more efficient workflow management.
- **Unauthenticated Job Search Implementation (Issue #56):** Transformed the job search experience to be accessible without authentication. Moved job search functionality from a protected `/search` route to the main homepage, allowing anyone to search for jobs without signing up. Removed AI-powered scoring from the search process to optimize performance - scoring now only occurs when authenticated users save jobs to their personal collection. Enhanced the job search results table with a cleaner column structure (Job Title, Company, Location, Posted Date, Salary, Details, Actions) and improved visual hierarchy. Added distinct color coding for action buttons (green for Save Job, purple for Tailor Resume) with authentication prompts for unauthenticated users. Implemented optimistic UI updates for instant feedback when saving jobs, and added comprehensive job details modal with full descriptions, qualifications, responsibilities, and benefits. The saved jobs page now features "View Details" buttons with Eye icons for consistency across the application, providing a seamless user experience whether browsing jobs anonymously or managing saved jobs as an authenticated user.
- **Enhanced Job Search with Full Pagination (Issue #58):** Implemented comprehensive pagination support to fetch all available jobs from SerpAPI, not just the first page. The search now retrieves up to 10 pages of results (with safety limits to prevent infinite loops) providing users with access to hundreds of jobs instead of just the initial 10-20. Added sophisticated conditional filtering based on authentication status: authenticated users see only jobs they haven't already saved (preventing duplicates in their workflow), while unauthenticated users see all available jobs for maximum discovery. Implemented backend deduplication logic to handle cases where SerpAPI returns duplicate jobs across pages. Added sortable columns to the job results table, allowing users to sort by Job Title, Company, Location, Posted Date, and Salary in both ascending and descending order. The sorting includes smart type handling for dates (chronological), salaries (numeric extraction from strings), and text fields (case-insensitive alphabetical). Visual sort indicators (chevron icons) show the current sort field and direction. Removed AI-powered summary generation from the search process for significantly faster results - jobs now return instantly without waiting for OpenRouter API calls. The implementation maintains all existing features while providing a much faster, more comprehensive job discovery experience.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in the required API keys and Firebase configuration details.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

You will need to populate `.env.local` with your credentials from Firebase, SerpApi, OpenRouter, and GitHub. The `.gitignore` file is already configured to keep this file private.

### 5. Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase project to handle authentication and data storage.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable Authentication:** In the Firebase Console, navigate to **Authentication** > **Sign-in method** and enable the **Email/Password** and **Google** providers.
3.  **Create Firestore Database:** Go to the **Firestore Database** section and create a new database in **Production mode**.
4.  **Create Firestore Index:** The application requires a composite index for querying resumes. Go to the Firestore `Indexes` tab and create a new composite index for the `resumes` collection with the following fields:
      * `userId` (Ascending)
      * `createdAt` (Descending)
5.  **Generate Service Account Key:** For backend services (resume upload, PDF parsing) to work locally, you need a service account key.
      * In the Firebase Console, go to **Project Settings** > **Service accounts**.
      * Click "Generate new private key".
      * Save the downloaded JSON file as `service-account-key.json` in the root of the project directory. This file is included in `.gitignore` and will not be committed.
      * Note: The service account key is required for PDF/DOCX resume uploads to function properly.

### 6. Run the Development Server

Once the setup is complete, you can start the local development server.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
